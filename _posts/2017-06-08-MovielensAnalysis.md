This is an ongoing project to analyze the 
[1M MovieLens data set](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
Inspiration for this project came from two places: First, I was 
looking for a fun way to brush up on my python/numpy/pandas skills because I 
do most of my statistical programming in C/C++ and reserve python for 
scripting. To prevent stagnation of my skills I wanted to start up a 
python-based project and rely on modules I don't use on a daily basis. 
The second reason was my dislike of Netflix's new thumbs up/down rating 
system. Instead of complaining about it, I figured the next best thing 
would be to make my own movie recommender. Progress has been slow, as I 
started this project when I was finishing up my dissertation. Now that 
I've finished my Ph. D., I plan to pick back up with this project.

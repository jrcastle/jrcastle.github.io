This [software package](https://github.com/jrcastle/EbyEAnalysis) was 
written over the span of my graduate career at the University of Kansas. 
This repository contains code written in C, C++ and python that reads data 
sets recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and returns physics insights 
through plots. Key statistical techniques utilized in this analysis include:

- Unfolding/deconvolution
- Poisson counting statistics
- Maximum likelihood estimation 
- $\chi^2$ hypothesis testing

  <br> Sample figure generated by this software, the significance of which is discussed 
  at length in this <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2244666"> physics analysis summary </a>.

Although the software is open source, the data on which it is run is not. 
The primary audience for this software would be the next-generation CERN 
researcher who would like to pick up where this analysis left off.

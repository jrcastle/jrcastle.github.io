My first passion in life was music.  For most of my young adult life, 
I aspired to be a jazz musician making a living by playing my saxophone. 
That dream followed me up until my senior year of high school when I 
discovered physics. While a majority of people would say they hated their physics 
courses in high school and college, I loved mine. I saw every homework 
and exam problem as a puzzle waiting to be solved, where each new	
challenge was met with excitement. I enjoyed physics so	much that I decided 
to pursue a Ph.D. in it at the University of Kansas. My dissertation research 
involved the statistical analysis of terabyte-sized data sets resulting from 
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions recorded by the 
[CMS detector](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/what-cms) at the 
[CERN LHC](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider). 
I successfully defended my dissertation in July 2017. 
You can find more information on my dissertation 
[here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2275797) and learn more about me 
professionally via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrcastle90).

I am currently seeking to utilize and expand the skills I have gained as a 
researcher at CERN by pursuing a career in data science. As an experimental 
physicist, I have extensive experience in the fields of physics, statistics, 
computer science, data science, and mathematics. In addition, my experience 
as a Ph.D. candidate has allowed me to develop skills in all phases of project 
management (design, execution, and defending), problem solving, critical 
thinking, and time management.

# [](#header-1)Hi there, I'm James!
I'm a recent graduate of the University of Kansas with a Ph. D. in physics.
My dissertation research involved the statistical analysis of terabyte-sized
data sets resulting from ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions recorded by the
[CMS detector](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/what-cms) at the
[CERN LHC](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider).
You can find more information on my dissertation
[here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2275797). I'm interested in pursuing
a career in Big Data analytics and high-performance computing.

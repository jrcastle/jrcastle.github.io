# [](#header-1)Hydrodynamic Flow in Ultrarelativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions

Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion 
Collider ((\text{RHIC})) and the Large Hadron Collider ((\text{LHC})) create a hot, dense 
state of matter that consists of strongly-interacting quarks and 
gluons, the so-called Quark-Gluon Plasma [1-6]. 
In early theoretical developments, the QGP was believed to behave as a gas, 
but has since been shown to instead behave as a nearly perfect 
fluid [1-4]. This fluid behavior mostly preserves shape components in the 
overlap region of the two colliding nuclei, which are reflected in the 
final-state particle spectra. These shape components are characterized 
using a Fourier expansion of the initial-state transverse energy density 
profile and final-state azimuthal particle density, respectively. For 
non-central collisions, the lenticular shape of the overlap region, as 
illustrated in Fig. 1, results in a dominant second-order term in the 
Fourier expansion. The second-order terms corresponds to an elliptic shape 
and, for the final-state spectra, is referred to elliptic flow.

Since the colliding nuclei are quantum systems, the positions of the 
nucleons within each nucleus fluctuate on a collision-by-collision 
basis. These quantum fluctuations result in drastically different 
initial-state shape components for collisions with same impact parameters. 
Quantum fluctuations additionally allow for stronger contributions from 
higher-order Fourier components, such as the third-order ((\text{triangular})) term. 

A series of rigorous analyses that tied in concepts from multiple fields including 
high-performance computing, physics, mathematics, and statistics were performed 
to study and understand the nature of these initial-state quantum fluctuations. 
These analysis and results have been presented at the 
[XXVI international conference on ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions](https://indico.cern.ch/event/433345/contributions/2358296/), 
which have lead to a conference proceedings published in the scholarly journal 
[Nuclear Physics A](https://authors.elsevier.com/tracking/article/details.do?aid=20866&jid=NUPHA&surname=Castle). 
An additional paper planned for Physics Letters B is currently in progress, with hopes to 
submit to the Journal by September 2017.

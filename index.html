  <h1>Hi there, I'm James!</h1>
  <p>I'm a recent graduate of the University of Kansas with a Ph. D. in physics. 
     My dissertation research involved the statistical analysis of terabyte-sized 
     data sets resulting from ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions recorded by the 
     <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/what-cms">CMS detector</a> at the 
     <a href="https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider">CERN LHC</a>. 
     You can find more information on my dissertation  
     <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2275797">here</a>. I'm interested in pursuing 
     a career in Big Data analytics and high-performance computing.</p>
